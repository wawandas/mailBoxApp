# SPA mailbox-app (VueJS + Vuex + vue-router + Webpack + ES6)

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For implementing this SPA I've used VueJs because I really like to work with this framework, it is simple and really well documented. 
This application works together with Vuex and vue-route. You can easily navigate to any message using proper parameter in url (/message:uid). In my opinion this application is easy to extend, maintain and futher develop.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
